# Basic Statistical Analysis with Python

This project is a simple, beginner-friendly example that shows how to do basic statistics in Python using the built-in `statistics` module. The notebook walks you through finding common statistics like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance for a sample dataset.

## 📌 What Does This Project Do?

The notebook will help you learn how to:

- ✅ Calculate the **mean** (average) of a list of numbers
- ✅ Find the **median** (middle value)
- ✅ Find the **mode** (most common value)
- ✅ Calculate the **standard deviation** (how spread out the numbers are)
- ✅ Calculate the **variance** (the average of the squared differences from the mean)

## 📦 What You Need

- Python 3.x (almost any recent version)
- Jupyter Notebook (can be installed with Anaconda, pip, or used in VS Code)
- No need to install anything extra – the `statistics` module comes with Python
